# 🧠 Company Classifier – Insurance Taxonomy Project

This project uses semantic similarity and machine learning to classify companies into a predefined insurance taxonomy. It leverages company descriptions, business tags, and sector metadata to assign relevant insurance-related labels.

## 🚀 Recommended: Run the Project Online (Colab)

To explore the project interactively **without setting up anything locally**, use the link below:

▶️ **[Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/RaresNitu03/ba62580f76321d4985e4dca78c302ee1/insurance_taxonomy_classification.ipynb)**  

This will open the notebook in a cloud-based environment, allowing you to:

- Run each cell step by step
- See intermediate outputs and visualizations
- Test the full classification pipeline in real time

> 📌 **Note**: The Colab version includes annotations, cell outputs, and is ready to run without local setup.


## 🗂 Files Included

- `Company_Classifier.ipynb`: Main notebook with the full classification pipeline.
- `Last_100.csv`: Subset of companies used for manual validation.

## 🧠 Technical Overview

The project pipeline combines classic machine learning techniques with modern semantic representation to enable multi-label classification.

### 🔹 Data Preparation
- Each company record includes description, tags, and metadata (sector, category, niche).
- These fields are concatenated into a single `full_text` string per company.

### 🔹 Embedding & Similarity
- The `full_text` is encoded using a transformer model from `sentence-transformers` to generate a semantic embedding (dense vector).
- Each insurance label from the taxonomy is also embedded in the same vector space.
- Cosine similarity is computed between each company vector and all label vectors to determine label relevance.

### 🔹 Pseudo-Labeling Strategy
- Top `k` labels (default: 5) are assigned as pseudo-labels if their similarity exceeds a threshold (default: 0.3).
- If no label passes the threshold, the fallback mechanism selects the top 3 most similar labels.

### 🔹 Model Training
- A TF-IDF vectorizer transforms the `full_text` into sparse feature vectors.
- A `LogisticRegression` classifier is trained in a `OneVsRestClassifier` wrapper, enabling multi-label learning.
- The model is trained only on companies that received pseudo-labels.

### 🔹 Prediction Function
- The trained model predicts label probabilities for each company.
- If no label passes the probability threshold, the fallback logic selects top 3 labels with highest probabilities.

### 🔹 Evaluation
- Final predictions are compared to manually labeled data.
- Accuracy is computed as the percentage of companies for which at least one predicted label overlaps with a true label.

## 📊 Results

The model was evaluated on a manually labeled subset (100 companies) with the goal of achieving high relevance, even in the absence of a complete ground truth.  
A prediction is considered correct if at least one label overlaps with human annotations.

## 🔧 Local Setup Instructions

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/company-classifier.git
cd company-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
