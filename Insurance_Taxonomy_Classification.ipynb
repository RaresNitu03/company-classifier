        "This project presents a robust classifier designed to categorize companies accurately according to a predefined insurance taxonomy. Given a list of companies with associated data—**including company descriptions, business tags, and industry-specific classifications**—the solution classifies each company into relevant insurance labels from a provided static taxonomy.\n",

        "**Objectives:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Develop a method to accurately map companies to one or multiple insurance taxonomy labels.\n",
        "*   Validate classifier performance effectively, considering the lack of a predefined ground truth.\n",

        "*   **Classification:** Implements advanced natural language processing techniques and domain-specific heuristics to assign appropriate insurance taxonomy labels.\n",
        "*   **Validation:** Employs custom evaluation methods tailored to real-world relevance, providing insights into classification accuracy and potential improvement areas.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What it Should Achieve:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Accuracy:** Ensure companies are correctly classified into meaningful and contextually appropriate insurance labels.\n",
        "*   **Scalability:** Although designed initially for a manageable dataset, the solution framework supports extension to large-scale data processing.\n",

        "In this project, I tackled the challenge of classifying companies into an insurance taxonomy without having a predefined training dataset. This constraint prevented me from using a conventional supervised learning approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "My approach involved combining available company information into a single text representation and leveraging semantic embeddings to measure similarity between company texts and taxonomy labels. Based on these semantic similarities, I initially generated \"pseudo-labels\" to approximate true labels for training purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "After assigning pseudo-labels, I trained a multi-label classification model using these labels, which were likely accurate for most cases. Following the training phase, I re-labeled the entire dataset by applying the trained model, ensuring greater label consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the final step, I validated my approach using a manually labeled subset of data, labeled with the assistance of other AI applications. I deliberately avoided training directly on this manually labeled dataset because of potential inaccuracies, mismatched taxonomy labels, and its limited size (only around 100 labeled examples), which would have compromised the reliability and generalization of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "This methodology enabled effective company classification despite limited labeled data, demonstrating robustness through semantic embedding and iterative pseudo-labeling strategies.\n",
        "Notably, the model achieved 65% accuracy when evaluated against the manually labeled dataset — a significant improvement compared to the 24% accuracy of the initial pseudo-labeling stage.\n",
